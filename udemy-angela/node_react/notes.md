To initialize a react project 


```
npm init react-app ./frontend
```


```
npx create-react-app frontend
```
This command will create a new directory called frontend in the root directory of the project.

To use this command we don't need to have a node_modules in the root of the project.

A `node_modules` and `package.json` will be created in the frontend directory.

```
npm start
```
Run this inside the frontend directory.
