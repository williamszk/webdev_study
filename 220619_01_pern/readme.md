Inside here we are following the tutorial:

In this project we have a Postgres Database running.

A Go client for making mock requests.

And an nodejs express backend.

For more references this is the continuation of the projects:
- 220611_02_postgres
- 220614_01_pern_no_asyncawait 


# Tasks:
- Take a look inside the tables of the database. OK 
- Remove and create the database again. OK
- Make the endpoints work. OK
- Change the order of the requests in the client.
    Make the post be the first, the get all seconds.
- Include requests for GET one specific item in the todo.
    Include request for PUT and change one item.
    And for DELETE.




# Some ideas:
- We could test a way to purposefully take down the database.
And see what we can do to make the application work.
We can explore different architectural objectives, for example:
Fault Tolerant and High Availability aims.
